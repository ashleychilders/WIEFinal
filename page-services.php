        <h2>Auto Body Refinishing</h2>
        <p>When it comes to paint, the smallest details can make a massive difference. Even the slightest
          cutting of a corner or the minutest imperfection can ruin the paint finish. Slick's
          requires the right tools, the right products, and the right professional. Whether refinishing is
          needed because of a collision or you are just looking to spruce up your ride, you can be sure that
          refinishing services through Slick's will be extraordinary.</p>

        <h2>Mechanical Repair</h2>
        <p>Repairing modern vehicles requires much more extensive knowledge than in the past because of computerized
          mechanical components and technological advances. New automobile features require specialized tools,
          and more importantly specialized training and knowledge to repair correctly. In an accident and normal wear and
          tear, it is important that your entire car is running smoothly. That is why Slick's has the ability to
          repair your vehicleâ€™s mechanical system as well as its body and structure.</p>
