**Comments**

- I used plugins for the photo effects and contact form on my site.
- On the contact page the link to map location is somewhat of a placeholder as there is not an actually location to map to for Slick's. I wanted to include this though to show how it would appear.
- To help with SEO optimization I downloaded the Yoast SEO plugin. This plugin gave me suggestions such as changing my tagline and alerted me to uncheck the box I had marked as discouraging search engines from indexing the site. It also provided feedback on pages and ways to improve as well as giving me an SEO score.
